# Django Blog Application

This is a practice project for my internship, where I built a simple Django blog application to showcase my skills in web development. The application allows users to create and manage blog posts, categories, and comments. It also includes features like rich text editing using `django-ckeditor`, user authentication, and a profile management system.

- **Comments**: Users can comment on blog posts.
- **Likes**: Users can like posts.
- **Profile Management**: Users have a profile with social media links and a bio.
